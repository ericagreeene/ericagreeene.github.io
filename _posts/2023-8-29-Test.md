title: How Bridge is Scored
---

<h1><strong>How Bridge is Scored </strong></h1>


<p>
There are two levels of scoring in a duplicate game: each hand is scored after it’s played and then each team (partnership pair) is given points based on how well they did compared to the other teams that played the same hands. We’ll use the most common Matchpoints (MPs) system to compare scores across teams. 
</p>
<h3>How A Single Hand is Scored</h3>


<p>
Each hand is scored based on the tricks that were bid and the tricks that were made. You get points for each trick you bid and made (<strong>contract points</strong>) and bonus points for hitting game, small slam or grand slam. Additionally, you get a smattering of points for making a non-game contract (<strong>a part contract</strong>) and for making tricks beyond your contract (<strong>overtricks</strong>).

Sometimes things don’t go as well and you aren't able to make your contract. You get penalized for each trick you failed to make, regardless of the suit or level of the contract. If your contract had been doubled or redoubled, you lose even more points for each trick you went down.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

The lesson here is that you can win by bidding aggressively, but you can also win by letting your opponents get too far out over their skis and then raising the stakes.

<h3>How to Score a Duplicate Competition</h3>


<p>
Duplicate competitions rank teams using a system called <strong>matchpoints (MPs) </strong>which awards points to pairs based on how their scores compare to the scores of the other players who played the same hand. For each hand, teams receive one MP for each pair whose score they beat and one-half MP for each pair whose score they tied. 
</p>



<pre class="prettyprint">Matchpoints Per Hand  = (1 x # of teams you beat) + (1/2 x  # of teams you tie)
Total Matchpoints         =  Sum of MPs over all hands played</pre>


<p>
Your total score is the sum of the MPs you won for each hand. The team with the most MPs wins. 
</p>
<p>
There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_bridge_movements">many different strategies</a> for circulating players and pre-dealt hands. Some of the strategies result in half the teams always playing North-South hands and half the players always playing East-West. In this case, there will be two winning teams (one for N-S and one for E-W).
